## Getting Started

The Ansible playbooks and roles made available here where created as part of a talk I delivered as part of <a href="https://bsidesbelfast.org">BSidesBelfast 2019</a>.  The idea being that you can take three Vagrant boxes and turn them into a 'learning network'.  The 'learning' isn't in the setting up/configuration of the network, moreso on what you can do with a fully functioning Active Directory environment if you are into all things Red Team / offensive security.  You want to get on with the business of learning/sharpening your offensive skillsets as opposed to spending countless hours setting the environment up.

I spent a LOT of timing researching this stuff and inevitably I came across lots of useful information out there online.  One source in particular is <a href="https://github.com/kkolk" target="_blank">kkolk</a> - their Microsoft SQL Server Ansible role is included here with perhaps a few very minor modifications/additions.
