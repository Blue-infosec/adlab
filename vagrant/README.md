### Requirements
Grab an install from <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">here</a>

### I've got everything installed, now what?
Hop over to the Ansible folder and follow the instructions

### FYI ...
Be patient while the raw boxes download from vagrantcloud.com.  Go off and have a coffee/tea/other beverage of choice.  Should take about 30 minutes to have 3 raw boxes in VirtualBox available for configuration

Other bits and pieces
General feedback is welcome ... you can find me on twitter (@jckhmr_t). I also have a (small, but developing) website.

Happy Hacking .... jckhmr
