### Requirements
Grab an installer from <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  I've created and tested the lab with Kali 2019.3.  It also works fine on Mac OS Mojave.  Just one word of advice - avoid combining Vagrant and Windows .... just so many problems.  I'm not sure what sure what the source of the problem is .... after hours I just cut my losses and moved back to the safety of my Kali box.

### I've got everything installed, now what?
Hop over to the Ansible folder and follow the instructions to configure the 3 raw boxes into a fully functioning Active Directory setup.

### FYI ...
Be patient while the raw boxes download from vagrantcloud.com.  Go off and have a coffee/tea/other beverage of choice.  Should take about 30 minutes to have 3 raw boxes in VirtualBox available for configuration

### Other bits and pieces
General feedback is welcome ... you can find me on twitter (@jckhmr_t). I also have a (small, but developing) website.

Happy Hacking .... jckhmr
